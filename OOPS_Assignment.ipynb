        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods). OOP promotes modularity, code reusability, and better organization by modeling real-world entities. The four key principles of OOP are:\n",
        "  Encapsulation: Wrapping data and methods within a class.\n",
        "  Abstraction: Hiding implementation details and exposing only necessary features.\n",
        "  Inheritance: Deriving new classes from existing ones.\n",
        "  Polymorphism: Allowing different classes to be treated as instances of the same class.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "  - A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that the objects will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "  class Car:\n",
        "      def __init__(self, brand, model):\n",
        "          self.brand = brand\n",
        "          self.model = model\n",
        "      \n",
        "      def display_info(self):\n",
        "          print(f\"Car: {self.brand} {self.model}\")\n",
        "  Here, Car is a class that has attributes brand and model and a method display_info().\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "  - An object is an instance of a class that holds actual values. It is created using a class and has access to its attributes and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "  car1 = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\")\n",
        "  car1.display_info()  # Output: Car: Toyota Corolla\n",
        "  Here, car1 is an object of the Car class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "  - Feature\tAbstraction\t:\n",
        "  Abstraction - Definition\tHides the implementation details and exposes only the functionality.\n",
        "  encapsulation - Hides the internal state and restricts direct access.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Purpose\t:\n",
        "  Abstraction - Focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
        "  encapsulation - Protects object integrity by preventing unintended modifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example\t:\n",
        "  Abstraction - Using an interface to define methods without implementation.\tMaking class encapsulation - variables private and providing getter/setter methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "  Abstraction:\n",
        "  from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
        "  class Animal(ABC):\n",
        "      @abstractmethod\n",
        "      def make_sound(self):\n",
        "          pass\n",
        "\n",
        "  class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "      def make_sound(self):\n",
        "          return \"Bark\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  dog = Dog()\n",
        "  print(dog.make_sound())  # Output: Bark\n",
        "\n",
        "  Encapsulation:\n",
        "  class BankAccount:\n",
        "      def __init__(self, balance):\n",
        "          self.__balance = balance  # Private variable\n",
        "\n",
        "      def get_balance(self):\n",
        "          return self.__balance  # Getter method\n",
        "\n",
        "  account = BankAccount(1000)\n",
        "  print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1000\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "  - Dunder (double underscore) methods are special methods in Python, also known as magic methods, that start and end with __. These methods define object behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Common Dunder Methods:\n",
        "  __init__ → Constructor (initializes objects).\n",
        "  __str__ → Returns a user-friendly string representation.\n",
        "  __repr__ → Returns an official string representation.\n",
        "  __len__ → Defines behavior for len() function.\n",
        "  __eq__, __lt__, __gt__ → Define comparison operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "  class Person:\n",
        "      def __init__(self, name):\n",
        "          self.name = name\n",
        "      \n",
        "      def __str__(self):\n",
        "          return f\"Person: {self.name}\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  person = Person(\"Alice\")\n",
        "print(person)  # Output: Person: Alice\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "    - Inheritance allows a class (child) to acquire properties and behaviors from another class (parent). This promotes code reuse and hierarchy.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Types of Inheritance:\n",
        "  Single Inheritance: One child class inherits from one parent class.\n",
        "  Multiple Inheritance: A child class inherits from multiple parent classes.\n",
        "  Multilevel Inheritance: A child class inherits from another child class.\n",
        "  Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple child classes inherit from the same parent.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "  class Animal:\n",
        "      def sound(self):\n",
        "          print(\"Animal makes a sound\")\n",
        "\n",
        "  class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "      def sound(self):\n",
        "          print(\"Dog barks\")\n",
        "\n",
        "  dog = Dog()\n",
        "  dog.sound()  # Output: Dog barks\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism allows methods to have different implementations based on the object calling them.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "  class Bird:\n",
        "      def fly(self):\n",
        "          print(\"Bird can fly\")\n",
        "\n",
        "  class Penguin(Bird):\n",
        "      def fly(self):\n",
        "          print(\"Penguins cannot fly\")\n",
        "\n",
        "  bird = Bird()\n",
        "  penguin = Penguin()\n",
        "\n",
        "  bird.fly()    # Output: Bird can fly\n",
        "  penguin.fly() # Output: Penguins cannot fly\n",
        "  Here, fly() behaves differently for different classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "  - Encapsulation is achieved using:\n",
        "  Private variables (__var): Not directly accessible outside the class.\n",
        "  Getters and setters: Used to access and modify private attributes.\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "  python\n",
        "  Copy\n",
        "  Edit\n",
        "  class Student:\n",
        "      def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
        "          self.__age = age  # Private variable\n",
        "\n",
        "      def get_age(self):\n",
        "          return self.__age  # Getter method\n",
        "\n",
        "  student = Student(\"John\", 20)\n",
        "print(student.get_age())  # Output: 20\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "  - A constructor (__init__ method) is a special method used to initialize an object's attributes when it's created.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "  class Person:\n",
        "      def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
        "          self.name = name\n",
        "          self.age = age\n",
        "\n",
        "  p1 = Person(\"Alice\", 25)\n",
        "  print(p1.name, p1.age)  # Output: Alice 25\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "  - Both @classmethod and @staticmethod define methods that aren't instance-specific.\n",
        "  Feature\t@classmethod :\n",
        "  a.It has Access to class variables\n",
        "  b. Takes cls as the first argument\n",
        "  \n",
        "  @staticmethod\n",
        "  a.It Does not have access to class variables\n",
        "  b. Does not takes cls as the first argument\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "  class Example:\n",
        "      class_var = \"Class Variable\"\n",
        "\n",
        "      @classmethod\n",
        "      def class_method(cls):\n",
        "          return cls.class_var  # Access class variable\n",
        "\n",
        "      @staticmethod\n",
        "      def static_method():\n",
        "          return \"Static Method\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  print(Example.class_method())  # Output: Class Variable\n",
        "  print(Example.static_method()) # Output: Static Method\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "  - Method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different arguments. However, Python does not support method overloading like other languages (e.g., Java). Instead, we can achieve similar behavior using default arguments or *args and **kwargs.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "  class Example:\n",
        "      def show(self, a=None, b=None):\n",
        "          if a is not None and b is not None:\n",
        "              print(f\"Two arguments: {a}, {b}\")\n",
        "          elif a is not None:\n",
        "              print(f\"One argument: {a}\")\n",
        "          else:\n",
        "              print(\"No arguments\")\n",
        "\n",
        "  obj = Example()\n",
        "  obj.show()         # Output: No arguments\n",
        "  obj.show(10)       # Output: One argument: 10\n",
        "  obj.show(10, 20)   # Output: Two arguments: 10, 20\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "  - Method overriding allows a child class to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "  class Parent:\n",
        "      def show(self):\n",
        "          print(\"Parent method\")\n",
        "\n",
        "  class Child(Parent):\n",
        "      def show(self):\n",
        "          print(\"Child method\")\n",
        "\n",
        "  obj = Child()\n",
        "  obj.show()  # Output: Child method\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "  - The @property decorator allows us to define getter methods, making a method behave like an attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "  class Person:\n",
        "      def __init__(self, name):\n",
        "          self._name = name\n",
        "\n",
        "      @property\n",
        "      def name(self):\n",
        "          return self._name  # Acts as a getter\n",
        "\n",
        "  p = Person(\"Alice\")\n",
        "print(p.name)  # Output: Alice\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism allows different objects to be treated as instances of the same class, enhancing flexibility and code reusability. It allows different classes to implement the same interface, making code more generic.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "  - An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and must be inherited. It is defined using the ABC module.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "  from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
        "\n",
        "  class Animal(ABC):\n",
        "      @abstractmethod\n",

        "  class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "      def sound(self):\n",
        "          return \"Bark\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  dog = Dog()\n",
        "  print(dog.sound())  # Output: Bark\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "  - Code reusability (inheritance).\n",
        "  Encapsulation (data hiding).\n",
        "  Polymorphism (flexibility).\n",
        "  Abstraction (hiding complexity).\n",
        "  Easier maintenance and scalability.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "  - Feature\tClass Variable\tInstance Variable\n",
        "  Scope\tShared across all instances\tUnique to each instance\n",
        "  Defined\tInside the class but outside methods\tInside the constructor (__init__)\n",
        "  Example\tself.class_var = value\tself.instance_var = value\n",
        "  Example:\n",

        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "    - Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class.\n",
