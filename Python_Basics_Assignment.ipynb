        "5. Why are lists are mutable and tuples are immutable in python?\n",
        "  -Why Lists are Mutable:\n",
        "      a. Lists are designed for dynamic data. They allow adding, removing, or modifying elements as needed during the program's execution. The mutability makes them ideal for scenarios where data needs to change frequently.\n",
        "\n",
        "      b. Supported operations:\n",
        "        appending, inserting, or updating elements in place. This flexibility makes them efficient for managing dynamic datasets without requiring new objects to be created.\n",
        "\n",
        "      c. Modifying a list in place makes more memory-efficient and faster than creating a new list with the updated data.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Example:\n",
        "      Lists:\n",
        "        my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "        my_list.append(4)  # Modifies the list\n",
        "        print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "\n",
        "  Why Tuples are Immutable\n",
        "      a. Tuples are designed for static data or as a lightweight alternative to lists when the data is not expected to change.\n",
        "\n",
        "      b.Tuples are immutable, which makes them hashable. Hashable objects can be used as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "      c. Immutability makes tuples inherently thread-safe, as their contents cannot be modified by different parts of the program, this prevents immutable objects prevent accidental modification, which can help avoid bugs and make code easier to reason about.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Example:\n",
        "      Tuples:\n",
        "        my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
        "        my_tuple[0] = 10  # This will raise an error because tuples are immutable\n",

        "Typical Use Cases\n",
        "for: Iterating through elements of a collection (e.g., list, dictionary) or running a loop a fixed number of times.\n",
        "while: Repeating tasks until a specific condition is met (e.g., user input or reaching a threshold).\n",
        "\n",
        "Infinite Loop Risk\n",
        "for: Less prone to infinite loops as the iteration is predefined.\n",

        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than for loop in python ?\n",
        "  -A while loop is more suitable than a for loop in situations where the number of iterations is not predetermined or depends on a dynamic condition that can change during the loop execution. A best scenario is when waiting for user input or an event to occur, and want the loop to continue until that condition is met.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following example the for loop limits the number of attempts to 3, but it doesn’t allow for an indeterminate number of retries, which makes the while loop more appropriate for this scenario.\n",
