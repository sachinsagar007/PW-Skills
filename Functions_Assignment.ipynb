        "  -  a) Function:\n",
        "      Definition: A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. It is defined using the def keyword.\n",
        "      Scope: Functions can exist independently of any class and can be called directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Usage Exaple:\n",

        "      print(greet(\"Alice\"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!\n",
        "\n",
        "      Example: print(), len(), and user-defined functions are examples of functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "     b) Method:\n",
        "      Definition: A method is a function that is associated with an object that is typically part of a class and operates on that object. It can access and modify the data within the object it belongs to.\n",
        "      Scope: Methods are defined within a class and require an instance of the class (or the class itself) to be called.\n",
        "      Usage:\n",

        "2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
        "  - a) Parameters:\n",
        "      Definition: Parameters are variables listed in the function definition. They act as placeholders for the values that the function will receive when it is called.\n",
        "      Scope: They exist only within the function and are used to perform operations.\n",
        "      Example:\n",
        "      def greet(name):  # 'name' is a parameter\n",
        "          return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
        "     b) Arguments\n",
        "      Definition: Arguments are the actual values passed to a function when it is called. These values are assigned to the corresponding parameters.\n",
        "      Example:\n",
        "      print(greet(\"Alice\"))  # 'Alice' is an argument\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
        "  - a) Positional Arguments:\n",
        "      Passed to the function in the same order as the parameters.\n",
        "      Example:\n",
        "      def add(a, b):\n",
        "          return a + b\n",
        "\n",
        "      print(add(3, 5))  # 3 and 5 are positional arguments\n",
        "\n",
        "     b) Keyword Arguments:\n",
        "      Passed by explicitly naming the parameter, allowing arguments to be provided out of order.\n",
        "      Example:\n",
        "      def introduce(name, age):\n",
        "          return f\"{name} is {age} years old.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "      print(introduce(age=30, name=\"Alice\"))  # age and name are keyword arguments\n",
        "\n",
        "      c) Default Arguments:\n",
        "      Parameters can have default values, which are used if no argument is provided.\n",
        "      Example:\n",
        "      def greet(name=\"stranger\"):\n",
        "          return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
        "\n",

        "      e) Using Lambda Functions\n",
        "        Lambda functions are anonymous, one-liner functions defined using the lambda keyword. They are often used for simple operations.\n",
        "        Example:\n",
        "        add = lambda x, y: x + y\n",
        "        Calling:\n",
        "        print(add(3, 5))  # Output: 8\n",
        "      \n",
        "      f) Calling a Function as an Argument\n",
        "        A function can be passed as an argument to another function.\n",
        "\n",
        "        Example:\n",
        "        def apply_function(func, value):\n",

        "        print(apply_function(double, 5))  # Output: 10\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the purpose of the 'return statement in a Python function?\n",
        "  - The return statement in a Python function serves the purpose of sending a value (or multiple values) back to the caller of the function. It ends the execution of the function and specifies the result to caller function.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Key Features of the return Statement\n",
        "      Returns a Value:\n",
        "      It allows a function to produce a result that can be used elsewhere in the program.\n",
        "      Example:\n",
        "      def add(a, b):\n",
        "          return a + b\n",
        "\n",
        "      result = add(3, 5)\n",
        "      print(result)  # Output: 8\n",
        "\n",
        "      Ends Function Execution:\n",
        "      Once a return statement is executed, the function stops, and any code after it is not executed.\n",
        "      Example:\n",
        "      def greet(name):\n",
        "          return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
        "          print(\"This will not execute\")  # Unreachable code\n",
        "\n",
        "      Returns Multiple Values:\n",
        "      Python allows returning multiple values as a tuple.\n",
        "      Example:\n",
        "      def calculate(a, b):\n",
        "          return a + b, a - b, a * b\n",
        "\n",
        "      add, subtract, multiply = calculate(5, 3)\n",
        "      print(add, subtract, multiply)  # Output: 8, 2, 15\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "  a) Iterables: An iterable is any object that can be iterated over (looped through) using a for loop. An iterable implements the __iter__() method, which returns an iterator.\n",
        "      Examples of Iterables:\n",
        "      Built-in data structures like lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, strings.\n",
        "      Custom classes implementing the __iter__() method.\n",
        "      Example:\n",
        "      # List is an iterable\n",
        "      my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "      for item in my_list:\n",
        "          print(item)\n",
        "      \n",
        "      Characteristics of Iterables:\n",
        "      They can be passed to the iter() function to obtain an iterator.\n",
        "      They do not store state for iteration; instead, the iterator handles it.\n",
        "\n",
        "  b) Iterators: An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data.\n",
        "     It produces the elements of an iterable one at a time using the __next__() method.\n",
        "      How it Works:\n",
        "      An iterator must implement two methods:\n",
        "      __iter__(): Returns the iterator object itself.\n",
        "      __next__(): Returns the next element in the sequence. Raises a StopIteration exception when there are no more elements.\n",
        "      Example:\n",
        "      # Obtaining an iterator from an iterable\n",
        "      my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "      iterator = iter(my_list)\n",
        "\n",
        "      print(next(iterator))  # Output: 1\n",
        "      print(next(iterator))  # Output: 2\n",
        "      print(next(iterator))  # Output: 3\n",
        "      # print(next(iterator))  # Raises StopIteration\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "  -Generators are a special type of iterable in Python, used to produce a sequence of values on demand rather than computing them all at once and storing them in memory. Generators are defined using functions, but instead of the return statement, they use the yield statement.\n",
        "  When a generator function is called, it does not execute immediately. Instead, it returns a generator object, which can be iterated over to produce values one at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Simple Generator:\n",
        "      def countdown(n):\n",
        "          while n > 0:\n",
        "              yield n\n",
        "              n -= 1\n",
        "\n",
        "      for number in countdown(5):\n",
        "          print(number)\n",
        "\n",
        "      Output:\n",
        "      5\n",
        "      4\n",
        "      3\n",
        "      2\n",
        "      1\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "  - Using generators instead of regular functions offers several advantages, particularly in terms of efficiency and code simplicity.\n",
        "  a) Memory Efficiency\n",
        "      Generators do not store all the values in memory at once. Instead, they produce values one at a time, as needed by evaluation.\n",
        "      Regular functions, when returning large data structures like lists, may require significant memory to hold all the elements.\n",
        "      Example:\n",
        "      # Using a generator\n",
        "      def generate_numbers(n):\n",
        "          for i in range(n):\n",
        "              yield i\n",
        "\n",
        "      gen = generate_numbers(10**6)  # Efficient, doesn't store all numbers in memory\n",

        "      def list_numbers(n):\n",
        "          return [i for i in range(n)]\n",
        "\n",
        "      lst = list_numbers(10**6)  # Memory-heavy, stores all numbers in memory\n",
        "  b) Support for Infinite Sequences\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "      def infinite_counter():\n",
        "    num = 0\n",
        "    while True:\n",
        "        yield num\n",
        "        num += 1\n",
        "\n",
        "      counter = infinite_counter()\n",
        "      print(next(counter))  # 0\n",
        "      print(next(counter))  # 1\n",
        "    \n",
        "  c)  On Demand Evaluation\n",
        "      Generators compute values only when required, avoiding unnecessary computations. Regular functions compute the entire result even if only part of it is used.\n",
        "      Example:\n",
        "      def square_numbers(n):\n",
        "          for i in range(n):\n",
        "              yield i ** 2\n",
        "\n",
        "      # Using only the first 3 values\n",
        "      gen = square_numbers(10)\n",
        "      print(next(gen))  # 0\n",
        "      print(next(gen))  # 1\n",
        "      print(next(gen))  # 4\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "  - A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword. Unlike regular functions defined with def, lambda functions are limited to a single expression and do not require a name.\n",
        "\n",

        "      Lambda functions are ideal for defining small, simple functions inline, especially when creating a full function definition would be overkill.\n",
        "      Example:\n",

        "      square = lambda x: x ** 2\n",

        "  - The map() function in Python is a built-in function that applies a given function to each item in an iterable (like a list, tuple, etc.) and returns a map object (which is an iterator). This is useful when you want to perform the same operation on every element of an iterable without explicitly writing a loop. The function passed to map() is applied to each element of the iterable in sequence, and the result is returned as an iterator that can be easily converted into a list, tuple, etc.\n",
        "\n",

        "      - The function double() takes one argument x and returns x * 2.\n",
        "      - The map() function applies the double() function to each element in the numbers list, resulting in the list [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].\n",

        "  -\n",
        "    a) map() Function:\n",
        "     The map() function is used to apply a given function to each item of an iterable (e.g., list, tuple) and return a map object (an iterator) that produces the results.\n",

        "      map(function, iterable)\n",

        "    How it works:\n",
        "      It applies the function to each element in the iterable and returns a map object that can be converted to a list or any other iterable.\n",

        "        - First, reduce() takes the first two elements (47 and 11) and applies the function to them:\n",
        "          - Step 1: 47 + 11 = 58\n",
        "        - Then, it applies the result (58) to the next element (42):\n",
        "          - Step 2: 58 + 42 = 100\n",
        "        - Finally, it applies the result (100) to the last element (13):\n",
        "          - Step 3: 100 + 13 = 113\n",
        "\n",
        "      d) *Result:*\n",
        "        - The final result is 113, which is the sum of all elements in the list.\n",

        "      result = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers)\n",
